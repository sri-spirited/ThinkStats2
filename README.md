ThinkStats2
===========

Text and supporting code for [Think Stats, 2nd Edition](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/index.html)

Chapter-wise code is in the 'code' folder.

Plots have been re-written in matplotlib, instead of using the book's thinkplot module.

In many ways, I found the code sections in this book limited in their usefulness, as it is better to code the functions, plots and tests yourself than to use the author's pre-defined modules and classes.
